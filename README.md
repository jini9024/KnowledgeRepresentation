# ontology_app
Music recommendation system

Semantic technologies have many advantages that includes improved data availability and better knowledge management. The aim of this project is to develop a music recommendation website that suggests user with the music based on the genre and artists they selects and also based on the industry by utilising the knowledge representation, semantic web technologies and ontologies.

The application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, Flask for the back end and SPARQL for data retrieval. The ontological structure is defined using RDF and OWL offering a comprehensive representation.

We have used music_spotipy.py code to retrieve data from spotify and to create a .ttl file with different genres, artists,mood and industry.
